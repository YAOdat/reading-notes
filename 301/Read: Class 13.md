#### What’s the relationship between REST and CRUD?

REST is an architectural system centered around resources and hypermedia, via HTTP protocols, and CRUD is a cycle meant for maintaining permanent records in a database setting. CRUD principles are mapped to REST commands to comply with the goals of RESTful architecture.

 #### If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?

1. Identify the resources – Object Modeling. The very first step in designing a REST API-based application is – identifying the objects which will be presented as resources.
2. Create Model URIs. 
3. Determine Resource Representations.

B) Security
