## Stack vs Queue

Stack is a container of objects that are inserted and removed according to the last-in first-out (LIFO) principle. Whereas, queue is a container of objects (a linear collection) that are inserted and removed according to the first-in first-out (FIFO) principle.


## What is Stacks and how to use it?

A stack is a conceptual structure consisting of a set of homogeneous elements and is based on the principle of last in first out (LIFO). There are many real life stack examples, such as:

* Back/Forward stacks on browsers.
* Undo/Redo stacks in Excel or Word.
* Activation records of method calls.

## What is Queue?

Queue is an abstract data type or a linear data structure, just like stack data structure, in which the first element is inserted from one end called the REAR(also called tail), and the removal of existing element takes place from the other end called as FRONT(also called head).
