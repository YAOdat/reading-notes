## Singly Linked Lists


### A linked lists is a sequential collection of elements. Each element in the linked list is called Node each node has two pieces of information the data in the node itself and a reference to the next node in the link. A linked list has a head and a tail.

**Note that**: 
* A linked list head is a reference to the first node in the list. (the head is not a node)
* The tail is a reference that points to null. It is the last element in the linked list.


## Doubly Linked Lists

### In the doubly linked list, there are three pieces of information, the data, previous reference, next reference. Each node points to the next node and to the previous node.

## Circular linked Lists

### In the circular linked list, all nodes are connected to each other forming a circle, the first node and the last node are connected to each other, so there is no NULL at the last node.
