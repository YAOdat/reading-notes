# The Command Line

# What is a Command Line?

> A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text. 

With the command line, you can perform tasks much quicker.


## Navigation Using Command-Line

**A lot of commands in linux are named as an abbreviation.*

### A List of Navigation Commmands: 

* pwd (Print Working Directory): It prints the path of the working directory, starting from the root (It tells you what your current or present working directory is).
* ls (List): It shows you the contents of your current location (ls -a if you want to show the hidden files too).
* cd (Change Directory): Lets you to move around in the system (cd [location]).

**Note that Linux is case sensitive, that means, for example, the command 'cD ..' won't work, however, the command 'cd ..' will work.*


### Manual Pages Commands:

* /< something >: Within a manual page, perform a search for 'something'.
* n After performing a search within a manual page, select the next found item.


### File Manipulation Commands:

* mkdir <Directory> (Make Directory): creates a directory witht the name 'Directory'.
* rmdir (Remove Directory): deletes a directory (use name or path after rmdir)
* touch: creates a blank file 
* cp (Copy): copies a directory or file
* mv (Move): moves a file or directory 
* rm (Remove): deletes a file.
