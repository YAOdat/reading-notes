## Upgrade your technical skills with deliberate practice

When you program everyday, that doesn't mean you get better at programming everyday. You may be coding but you just repeat the things that you already master that is why you need 'Deliberate Practice'. Deliberate practice gets you out of your comfort zone and makes you learn new things. 

> The key ideas behind deliberate practice is that it:

> * Pushes you just outside your comfort zone
Repeated often
> * Feedback on results in continuously available
> * It's highly demanding mentally
> * It's difficult
> * It requires good goals [1]



## Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset

Give yourself time to succeed, make challenges out of difficulties, and engage with the error instead of running away from it. These three points can bring you a growth mindset.


##  Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit

Grit and persistence are some of the keys to succeed as a programmer.

## Measuring Emotional Intelligence

I am excellent when it comes to self-awareness and self-management, and very good when it comes to relationship management, however I need to spend more time improving my social awareness. Things are getting better.


## Assessing Bias

I have high self awareness, curiosity, and courage. But this is not a
topic I ever master. I should continue your journey in this area by examining. It seems that I have done better than the last time I took this assessment, however, I still have room for improvement.
