## Upgrade your technical skills with deliberate practice

When you program everyday, that doesn't mean you get better at programming everyday. You may be coding but you just repeat the things that you already master that is why you need 'Deliberate Practice'. Deliberate practice gets you out of your comfort zone and makes you learn new things. 

> The key ideas behind deliberate practice is that it:

> * Pushes you just outside your comfort zone
Repeated often
> * Feedback on results in continuously available
> * It's highly demanding mentally
> * It's difficult
> * It requires good goals [1]
