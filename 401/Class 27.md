# Graph Data Strucutre 

Graph data structure is a non-linear data structure made up of a finite or infinit number of nodes or vertices and the edges that connect them. 
Vertices are the nodes in the graph.
Two adjacent vertices are joined by edges.

## Distance Between Two Vertices
 It s basically the number of edges that are available in the shortest path between vertex A and vertex B.
 

## Types of Graphs:
Finite Graph

The graph is called a finite graph if the number of vertices and edges in the graph is limited in number.

Infinite Graph

The graph G=(V, E) is called an ifinite graph if the number of vertices and edges in the graph is interminable.

Trivial Graph

A graph is trivial if it contains only a single vertex and no edges.

Simple Graph

If each pair of nodes or vertices in a graph G=(V, E) has only one edge, it is a simple graph.

Multi Graph

If there are numerous edges between a pair of vertices in a graph, the graph is a multigraph
