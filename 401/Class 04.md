## Sequelize 

Sequelize is a modern TypeScript and Node.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and SQL Server, and more. [1](https://sequelize.org/)
Basically, Sequelize converts JavaScript object to database (NoSQL to SQL).

With the command below, you can install Sequelize package. 
```
npm i sequelize
```
